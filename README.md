# WPF App Reference

This repository serves as a reference for my work, showcasing a desktop application I developed using .NET WPF technology. The project was the result of a long-term collaboration on an application for a manufacturing company. Initially, it was designed to primarily monitor hourly production output, but over time, additional modules were implemented, covering areas such as logistics, planning, and more.

This version of the application was created over 12 years ago. Subsequent versions were gradually transitioned to web technologies, first using .NET on both the client and server sides, and later replacing the client with Angular 2.

## 01_source_code
It may not be directly compatible with modern versions of Visual Studio, but it should be straightforward to explore the code, understand the project structure, and review the underlying principles.

## Manuals
The remaining files are a showcase of manuals for the application, but unfortunately, they are only available in Czech. However, they do provide a glimpse of the application's graphics.
